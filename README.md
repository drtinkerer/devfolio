## üé® Customization

### Personalizing Your Portfolio

All the content of your portfolio can be customized by editing the files in the `data/` directory:

#### 1. Personal Information (`data/personal.ts`)

Update your identities and professional description:

```typescript
// Array of professional identities to display in the hero section
export const identities = [
  "a Developer üíª",
  "a Designer üé®",
  // Add your own identities
];

// Professional description paragraphs for the hero section
export const professionalDescription = {
  paragraph1: "With X years of professional experience, I specialize in... [your main professional paragraph]",
  paragraph2: "Let's transform your ideas into reality! üöÄ"
};
```

#### 2. Projects (`data/projects.ts`)

Showcase your projects by editing this file with your project details, including:
- Title, description, and image URL
- Technologies used
- GitHub repository and live demo links

#### 3. Experience (`data/experience.ts`)

Edit your work experience history with:
- Company names, positions, and durations
- Responsibilities and achievements
- Company logos and links

#### 4. Certifications (`data/certifications.ts`)

Add your professional certifications:

```typescript
export const certifications: Certification[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Your Certification Name",
    issuer: "Certification Issuer",
    date: "Month Year",
    credlyBadgeId: "your-credly-badge-id" // From your Credly badge URL
  },
  // Add more certifications...
];
```

#### 5. Tech Stack (`data/tech-stack.ts`)

Update the technologies you're proficient in.

#### 6. Navigation (`data/navigation.ts`)

Customize the navigation menu items if needed.

### Setting Up Credly Badges

This portfolio uses local PNG images instead of iFrames for Credly badges:

1. **Get your badge ID**: For each certification on Credly, get the badge ID from your public URL (e.g., `https://www.credly.com/badges/1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j/public_url` ‚Üí badge ID is `1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j`)

2. **Download badge images**: 
   - Go to your Credly badge page
   - Right-click on the badge image and save it
   - Remove the white background (using tools like remove.bg or Photoshop)
   - Save the transparent PNG with your badge ID as the filename (e.g., `1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j.png`)

3. **Add badges to your project**:
   - Place all badge PNG files in the `/public/credly-badges/` directory
   - Each badge should be named exactly with the badge ID and .png extension

### Adding Your Own Tech Icons

1. Place your SVG icons in the `public/floating-icons` directory
2. The icons will be automatically loaded and displayed in the background
3. Icons will inherit the floating animation and click interactions

### Modifying Colors

The color scheme can be customized in the `tailwind.config.js` file:
```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      electricBlue: {...},
      circuitGreen: {...},
      steelGray: {...},
      brushedAluminum: {...}
    }
  }
}
```
